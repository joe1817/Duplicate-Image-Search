TODO
	checkbox option: matches must be in different folders
	right-click path element: select all duplicates in this folder
	buttons: "clear" & "select all"
	compare selection to others in cluster (similarity %)
	pHash (DCT hash)
	anything with event listeners (Image, FileReader, etc.) need to have listeners nullified when done, otherwise the closures can prevent GC
	use vue router so user can "go back" to results page before starting a new search
		for some reason, the results page is caching old results, won't start fresh when doing a second scan
	turn cluster info into a table
		Would simplify some of the CSS
	? VP-Tree for finding matches
		The current search is already very fast compared to the IO
	? createBitmapImage, static offscreenCanvas
		Testing did not yield significant performance gains
	? run the search in a webworker
		This would prevent the page from running locally without a server
		Testing did not yield significant performance gains, probably because the browser already offloads some IO tasks to separate threads

Some minor bug fixes
	Aspect ratio comparisons allowed width/height to be swapped
	Error in calculating index for RGB values given row&col, but it didn't glitch out b/c it was consistent
	normalize() would fill B/W image chroma values with NaN, this would cause chroma comparisons in is_similar() to always pass when comapring any B/W image to any colored image
Javascript was completely rewritten
	variables and functions given meaningful, non-random names (de-obfuscated)
	useless variables removed
	some encapsulation with a new ImageFile class
New features
	accept folders via drag-and-drop, pasting
	exact matching
	pause the search and resume
	display file size and last modification time along with the path
	highlight images in the results and save your selections to a text file or deletion script
	click-and-drag to highlight multiple images
	ctrl-click to copy a file's path to clipboard
	hide cluster group by clicking number
	close textarea with escape key
New features (Electron version)
    faster searching and thumbnail generation
    crtl-click to open an image's location in the file browser
    does not ask for confirmation to start search
